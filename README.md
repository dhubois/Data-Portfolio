# Data-Portfolio

This Portfolio contains a mulititude of projects, and practice notebooks. Many projects are found on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)! 
However, I have added here many notebooks of projects I've worked on throughout my Master's of Data Science, Google Certificates, and 
Harvad CS109x course. Also, the practice notebooks are just helpful notebooks to help get reaccustomed to certain packages or helpful
programming practices!
