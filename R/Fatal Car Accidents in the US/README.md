# FARS Analysis

### Unguided Project for Data Wrangling Course

* To reproduce my code locally, download the `All-in-one.zip` and run the __.Rproj__ file. You have full access to all datasets used and not used, and 
the file paths to read the datasets do not have to be changed.

Every year, NHTSA comes out with a summary fatal car crashes in the United States. 
My interest with this project was to analyze the data from 2010 to 2020 to determine if a better understanding of the factors that contribute to these accidents can be learned.

_Datasets Used_

Available **here** in the [`datasets`](https://github.com/dhubois/Data-Portfolio/tree/main/R/Fatal%20Car%20Accidents%20in%20the%20US/datasets) folder.

* `Atmospheric_Conditions_2010-2020.csv`
* `Crash_Body_Class_2010-2020.csv`
* `Crash_per_Month_2010-2020.csv`
* `Crashes_State.csv`
* `First_Harmful_Event_2010-2020.csv`
* `Florida_county_crashes.csv`
* `Vehicle_Make_2010-2020.csv`

### Steps Taken in this Analysis

1. Data Gathering from NHTSA's web-based Query
2. Build a Column Name Cleaning Function
3. Cleaned Data
4. Data Wrangling to have Tidy Data
5. Data Visualization using Diverse Plots
